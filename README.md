# Student Management System

A console-based application developed in C during my 1st semester (2020) that:

- Calculates grades and averages
- Implements binary search for records
- Uses file handling for data persistence

## Features
- Menu-driven interface
- Grade calculation (A-F)
- Binary search implementation
- File I/O operations

## How to Run
